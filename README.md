# Solving--Wild--Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Minimax-Search
 
The project's purpose is to create a minimax algorithm for both tic-tac-toe and wild tic-tac-toe games. Using the minimax method, the player selects an index with the best chance of winning the game. In wild tic-tac-toe, the user gets to choose either "x" or "o" at every opportunity.
